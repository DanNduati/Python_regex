<h1 align="Center"><b>Python-Regex</b></h1>
Wikipedia defines Regex as:

> A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp; sometimes referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. Regular expression techniques are developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.

A regex is a special sequence of characters that defines a pattern for complex string-matching functionality.

## <b>Why am I learning this?</b>
While trying to build a [parser for KPLC pdf documents](https://github.com/DanNduati/Stima-ScraParser), I quickly realised that basic string matching wasnt going to cut it and i had to use Regex and my superficial understanding of it does not help either.
